# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Introduction

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source protocol for building LLM tool use functionality with a focus on standardization and interoperability. It defines a standard API for LLMs to interact with tools and external resources, allowing for consistent behavior across different LLM providers and applications.

## Key Features

- **Standard Tool Format**: MCP defines a standard schema for tools and how LLMs should interact with them
- **Resource Access**: Provides standardized ways for LLMs to access external resources like files, APIs, and databases
- **Provider Neutral**: Works across different LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and others
- **Sampling API**: Defines how clients can specify parameters for generating text from an LLM
- **Tool Selection**: Standardizes how LLMs decide which tools to use based on user inputs

## Benefits

1. **Interoperability**: Tools and clients built for one LLM can work with others without modification
2. **Consistency**: Users get consistent tool use behavior regardless of the underlying LLM
3. **Standardization**: Developers follow a common pattern for tool implementation
4. **Flexibility**: Support for synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns

## Implementation

MCP defines JSON formats for messages between LLMs, clients, and tools. A typical interaction follows this pattern:

1. Client sends a prompt to an LLM
2. LLM decides if tools are needed
3. If yes, LLM formats a tool call according to MCP
4. Tool executes and returns results in MCP format
5. LLM incorporates tool results into its response

## Getting Started

To use MCP, you can leverage existing implementations like the MCP Agent library, which provides a high-level API for building agents with MCP. The library handles the communication protocol details, allowing you to focus on building tool functionality.
